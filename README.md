## Quickstart

### prerequisites

Below you'll find the commands needed to quickly get this project up and running. Before getting started you'll need to have [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) and the `git` installed.
to check if you have these run the following command: `yarn --version; git --version`. The result should look something like the following:

```
1.22.5
git version 2.21.1 (Apple Git-122.3)
```

### Let's get started!

1. `git clone https://github.com/KarnellSchultz/perils-app.git`
2. `cd perils-app`
3. `yarn install`
4. `yarn dev`

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn prettier:check`

When you want to check if your files are formatted, you can run Prettier with the --check flag (or -c). This will output a human-friendly message and a list of unformatted files, if any.

### `yarn prettier:fix`

This rewrites all processed files in place. This is comparable to the eslint --fix workflow. You can also use -w alias.
